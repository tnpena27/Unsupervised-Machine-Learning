# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Using unsupervised ML techniques to solve real-life business problems

### Project Overview/Instructions
In this project, you will work with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. Your job as a data scientist will be to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, you will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

####  The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:
* NumPy
* pandas
* Sklearn / scikit-learn
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Seaborn (for data visualization)

#### Project Data
Data used for this project is unavailable to the public and have been removed per licensing agreement with Udacity and as stated in the project intructions below:

"There are a number of files used for this project available in the workspace on the next page. It is strongly recommended that you complete and turn in this project from the workspace. As you will see from the agreement on the next page, if you choose to download a .zip file you will need to REMOVE the files from your computer via the agreement with Arvato Bartlesmann after completing the project, as the data are proprietary. The files available for the project are:

Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
Data_Dictionary.md: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.
Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for completing the project. The notebook provides more details and tips than the outline given here."
